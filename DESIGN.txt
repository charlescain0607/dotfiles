--- Design Outline ---

Here are the elements of design that I want to keep in mind while creating the desktop environment:

1. Minimal - It should be very minimalistic, primarily to prevent distraction. To be specific:
	> Packages - the environment should require a relatively small amount of packages, each performing a single job well, no multitaskers
		>> Vim, Sublime Text, and Nano are all text editors, so only one of these should be installed. 
	> Interface - no cluttered interface, should look good with solid color as background, or very minimal background
	> File System - shouldn;t be multiple system folders for things like fonts, colorschemes, etc.
2. Descriptive - all relevant system information should be displayed neatly somewhere in the interface
	> Polybar - should include cpu, ram, temp, workspaces, wifi, vol, brightness, time, bat, package updates
	> Vim - should display filename, location, file type via powerline
	> Font - there should be a single font applied universally, which contains all relevant glyphs 
	> Notifications - should select a single notification daemon which is easily configured, again not a multitasker
3. Adaptive - since I'm never perfectly content with a single color scheme, there should be some kind of color management system that adapts the entire system to a color scheme
	> Pywal - the functions of pywal should be expanded to any commonly used program/application
	> CLI - the command line should have features like autocomplete
4. Easy - the keyboard shortcuts should be plentiful and predictable
	> Use applications with vim keybindings, so that only one set of keybindings needs to be used
5. CLI-Focused
	> If an application has a command line variation, like spotify, then it should be utilized
6. Self-assembling
	> Significant work should be put into creating and maintaining a script that installs the ENTIRE system from ground zero, placing the necessary config files in the correct places, etc. 
	> github - required config files should be backed up to github
